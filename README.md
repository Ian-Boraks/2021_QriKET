## Introduction

TODO

## Basic principles

We demonstrate nearest centroid classification as implemented in, 
1) a fully classical model and 
2) a model taking advantage of quantum distance estimation. Clustering was used to identify game state advantage in generated game boards. The quantum model is compared with the classical model to evaluate the efficacy of the quantum model in comparison to that of the classical model.
